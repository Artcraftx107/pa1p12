This is a practical exercise for Advanced Programming 1, which was known before as Object Oriented Programming. Its a pretty basic program, which basically just groups the objects "Book" in a list holded in the class Library. 

Has a few methods oriented to adding, removing, updating price... 

As I said, pretty basic lol
